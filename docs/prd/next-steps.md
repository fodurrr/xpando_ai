# Next Steps

## Epic Sequencing Optimization
Based on comprehensive prioritization analysis, the current epic sequence remains optimal with **pipeline development timing adjustments**:

- **Epic 1: Foundation & Proof of Learning** (Months 1-2.5) - Accelerated to prove collective intelligence faster
- **Epic 2: AI Provider Integration & Mother Core** (Months 2.5-5) - Overlapped start while Epic 1 is 80% complete
- **Epic 3: Expert Specialization & Network Scaling** (Months 5-8) - Begin while Epic 2 is 70% complete
- **Epic 4: XPD Token Economy** (Months 8-12) - Start earlier while Epic 3 is 60% complete

This **pipeline approach reduces total development time from 12 to 10 months** while maintaining the layered evolution strategy's risk mitigation benefits. The technical foundation-first approach scored 80/100 against alternative sequences, providing optimal balance of risk management, user validation speed, and sustainable development.

## UX Expert Prompt
Review this PRD's User Interface Design Goals section and create detailed wireframes and user experience flows for xPando's distributed AI platform. Focus on the Phoenix LiveView dashboard with real-time network visualization, DaisyUI component integration, and the challenge of making complex distributed AI concepts intuitive for AI researchers and distributed computing enthusiasts. Execute the prototyping validation plan to ensure the real-time network visualizations perform well with 50+ nodes and that users can complete core tasks within 30 seconds of first use.

## Architect Prompt
Design the technical architecture for xPando based on this PRD, focusing on the Elixir/OTP + Ash Framework stack with Phoenix LiveView frontend and Solana blockchain integration. Address the distributed Mother Core implementation, P2P networking scalability to 100+ nodes, Broadway pipeline architecture for AI providers, and Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanisms. Validate performance assumptions for sub-500ms response times and 10,000+ concurrent connections while ensuring the layered evolution approach from proof-of-learning through economic integration supports the optimized pipeline development timeline.
