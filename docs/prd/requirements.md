# Requirements

## Functional

1. **FR1:** The system shall implement Ash-powered domain layer with all core entities (Nodes, Knowledge, Contributions) defined as Ash Resources with full CRUD operations.

2. **FR2:** The system shall provide a Phoenix LiveView web interface with real-time dashboard using DaisyUI components for node monitoring, knowledge visualization, and system status.

3. **FR3:** The system shall establish basic P2P network functionality including node discovery via libcluster, GenServer communication between nodes, and Phoenix Channels messaging for real-time updates.

4. **FR4:** The system shall integrate multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) through Broadway pipeline architecture with adapter pattern for extensibility.

5. **FR5:** The system shall implement Mother Core knowledge management using Ash Resources with PostgreSQL persistence via ash_postgres for storing and retrieving collective intelligence.

6. **FR6:** The system shall enable knowledge sharing between nodes with basic merge strategies and confidence scoring implemented via Ash calculations.

7. **FR7:** The system shall support expert specialization across three initial dimensions modeled as Ash attributes to enable domain-specific AI capabilities.

8. **FR8:** The system shall provide authentication system using ash_authentication for both node identity management and user access control.

9. **FR9:** The system shall include administrative dashboard using ash_admin for internal monitoring, management, and system health oversight.

10. **FR10:** The system shall create and manage XPD tokens on Solana blockchain using SPL Token program with basic distribution mechanisms for rewarding contributions.

11. **FR11:** The system shall integrate Solana wallet connectivity through LiveView components enabling users to connect wallets and manage XPD tokens.

12. **FR12:** The system shall implement knowledge contribution tracking with quality scoring to determine XPD token rewards for node participants.

## Non Functional

1. **NFR1:** The system shall achieve sub-500ms average response time for local Mother Core inference queries under normal load conditions.

2. **NFR2:** The system shall maintain 95% accuracy on benchmark tasks within established specialized domains compared to isolated AI operation.

3. **NFR3:** The system shall propagate knowledge updates to all network nodes within 1 hour of Mother Core acceptance.

4. **NFR4:** The system shall provide zero-downtime operation with self-healing recovery completing within 30 seconds of failure detection.

5. **NFR5:** The system shall support concurrent connections from 10,000+ nodes without performance degradation below acceptable thresholds.

6. **NFR6:** The system shall implement Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus across multiple Genesis Nodes preventing single points of failure.

7. **NFR7:** The system shall use ash_postgres for all PostgreSQL interactions ensuring ACID compliance and data consistency across distributed operations.

8. **NFR8:** The system shall implement comprehensive logging and monitoring using OTP supervision trees for fault tolerance and system observability.

9. **NFR9:** The system shall ensure secure communication between nodes using end-to-end encryption for sensitive knowledge transfer.

10. **NFR10:** The system shall maintain token operation throughput sufficient for XPD distribution without blocking core AI functionality.
