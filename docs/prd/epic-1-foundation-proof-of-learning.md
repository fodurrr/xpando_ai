# Epic 1: Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational Elixir/Phoenix project with Ash Framework integration, implement basic P2P networking capabilities, and demonstrate measurable collective intelligence improvement through collaboration of 3-5 nodes without economic complexity. This epic proves the core hypothesis that distributed AI nodes can learn from each other and deliver superior performance compared to isolated operation, while establishing robust project infrastructure including authentication, monitoring, and basic web interface.

## Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Core Domain Setup
**As a developer,**
**I want a complete Elixir umbrella project with Ash Framework integration,**
**so that I can build distributed AI functionality on solid architectural foundations.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Elixir umbrella application created with core, web, and node apps properly structured
2. Phoenix Framework integrated with LiveView capabilities and DaisyUI/Tailwind CSS styling
3. Ash Framework ecosystem fully configured including ash_postgres, ash_authentication, ash_phoenix
4. PostgreSQL database configured with Ash migrations for core domain entities
5. Basic CI/CD pipeline established with testing, linting, and deployment automation
6. Development environment fully documented with setup instructions
7. Core domain models defined as Ash Resources: Node, Knowledge, Contribution entities

## Story 1.2: Authentication & Node Identity Management
**As a node operator,**
**I want secure authentication and identity management for my AI node,**
**so that I can participate in the network with verified identity and appropriate permissions.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. ash_authentication configured with node registration and login capabilities
2. Node identity system supporting unique node IDs and cryptographic key pairs
3. Basic user authentication for web dashboard access
4. Permission system distinguishing node operators from regular users
5. Session management and secure token handling implemented
6. Node identity verification preventing duplicate or malicious registrations
7. Authentication policies integrated with all Ash Resources

## Story 1.3: Basic P2P Network Discovery & Communication
**As a distributed AI node,**
**I want to discover and connect with other nodes in the network,**
**so that I can participate in collective learning and knowledge sharing.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. libcluster configured for automatic node discovery and clustering
2. GenServer-based node management with supervision trees for fault tolerance
3. Phoenix Channels implemented for real-time node-to-node messaging
4. Basic node status tracking (online, offline, connecting) across the network
5. Connection health monitoring and automatic reconnection logic
6. Network topology tracking showing which nodes are connected to which
7. Support for 3-5 concurrent nodes with stable connections

## Story 1.4: LiveView Dashboard & Network Visualization
**As a node operator,**
**I want a real-time web dashboard showing network status and node activity,**
**so that I can monitor my node's participation and the overall network health.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Phoenix LiveView dashboard displaying real-time network topology
2. DaisyUI components providing consistent, attractive interface elements
3. Interactive network graph showing connected nodes and connection status
4. Individual node detail views with status, uptime, and basic metrics
5. Real-time updates via WebSocket connections without page refresh
6. Responsive design working on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
7. Basic navigation structure supporting future feature additions

## Story 1.5: Knowledge Representation & Storage
**As an AI system,**
**I want structured knowledge representation and persistent storage,**
**so that I can capture, store, and share learning with other nodes effectively.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Knowledge Ash Resource defining structure for storing AI insights and learning
2. ash_postgres integration providing ACID-compliant knowledge persistence
3. Basic knowledge metadata including confidence scores, creation timestamps, source nodes
4. Knowledge versioning system tracking updates and improvements over time
5. Simple knowledge query interface for retrieving relevant information
6. Data validation ensuring knowledge integrity and preventing corruption
7. Support for different knowledge formats (text, structured data, embeddings placeholder)

## Story 1.6: Proof of Collective Intelligence Demonstration
**As a researcher,**
**I want measurable evidence that connected nodes outperform isolated nodes,**
**so that I can validate the collective intelligence hypothesis before scaling.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Simple benchmark task implementation (e.g., text classification, Q&A) for measuring performance
2. Isolated node baseline performance measurement and recording
3. Connected network performance measurement with same benchmark tasks
4. Statistical comparison showing measurable improvement (minimum 10% better accuracy or speed)
5. Performance metrics dashboard displaying results in real-time
6. Automated testing suite validating collective intelligence improvements
7. Documentation of results proving distributed collaboration effectiveness
