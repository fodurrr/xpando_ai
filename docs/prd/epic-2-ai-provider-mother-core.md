# Epic 2: AI Provider Integration & Mother Core

**Epic Goal:** Implement Broadway pipeline architecture for seamless integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), create the distributed Mother Core using Ash Resources for centralized knowledge aggregation and distribution, and enable sophisticated knowledge sharing between nodes with confidence scoring and merge strategies. This epic transforms the basic P2P network into a true collective intelligence platform capable of learning from external AI providers while building internal knowledge capabilities.

## Story 2.1: Broadway Pipeline & AI Provider Adapter Framework

2. Generic AI provider adapter interface supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google APIs
3. Rate limiting and quota management preventing API abuse and cost overruns
4. Credential management system securely storing and rotating API keys
5. Provider failover logic automatically switching between available providers
6. Request/response logging and monitoring for debugging and cost tracking
7. Async processing preventing UI blocking during AI provider calls

## Story 2.2: OpenAI Integration with Response Caching
**As a user,**
**I want seamless integration with OpenAI's API with intelligent caching,**
**so that I can access GPT capabilities efficiently while minimizing costs.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. OpenAI API client integrated through Broadway adapter pattern
2. Support for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models with configurable selection
3. Response caching system using ETS preventing duplicate API calls
4. Token usage tracking and cost estimation displayed in dashboard
5. Error handling for rate limits, quota exhaustion, and network failures
6. Streaming response support for real-time user feedback
7. Integration tests validating all OpenAI interaction scenarios

## Story 2.3: Anthropic & Google AI Provider Integration
**As an AI system,**
**I want access to multiple AI providers for diverse capabilities and redundancy,**
**so that I can provide robust service even if one provider is unavailable.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Anthropic Claude API integration following same adapter pattern as OpenAI
2. Google AI (Gemini/PaLM) API integration with unified interface
3. Provider selection logic choosing optimal provider based on query type
4. Cross-provider response comparison and confidence scoring
5. Fallback chains ensuring service continuity during provider outages
6. Unified response format normalizing outputs across different providers
7. Performance metrics comparing provider speed, accuracy, and costs

## Story 2.4: Mother Core Knowledge Aggregation System
**As the collective intelligence system,**
**I want centralized knowledge aggregation and distribution capabilities,**
**so that I can learn from all nodes and share the best insights across the network.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Mother Core implemented as distributed Ash Resource with PostgreSQL persistence
2. Knowledge ingestion pipeline processing contributions from all connected nodes
3. Confidence scoring algorithm evaluating knowledge quality and reliability
4. Knowledge deduplication preventing redundant storage of similar insights
5. Version control system tracking knowledge evolution and improvement over time
6. Knowledge categorization and tagging for efficient retrieval and organization
7. Real-time knowledge distribution to all nodes within 1-hour target

## Story 2.5: Advanced Knowledge Merge Strategies
**As a distributed AI network,**
**I want sophisticated algorithms for combining knowledge from multiple sources,**
**so that I can create superior collective insights beyond individual node capabilities.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Weighted voting system combining insights based on source node reliability
2. Conflict resolution algorithms handling contradictory knowledge from different sources
3. Consensus mechanisms ensuring knowledge accuracy before Mother Core acceptance
4. Knowledge synthesis creating new insights by combining related information
5. Temporal knowledge management handling time-sensitive information appropriately
6. Domain-aware merging considering specialized expertise in different areas
7. Merge strategy performance metrics showing improvement over simple averaging

## Story 2.6: Knowledge Quality Scoring & Validation
**As a knowledge consumer,**
**I want reliable quality indicators for all knowledge in the system,**
**so that I can trust the information and make informed decisions based on collective intelligence.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-dimensional quality scoring considering accuracy, relevance, freshness, and consensus
2. Validation pipeline testing knowledge against known benchmarks and ground truth
3. Peer review system allowing nodes to validate each other's contributions
4. Historical accuracy tracking adjusting node reputation based on past performance
5. Quality threshold enforcement preventing low-quality knowledge propagation
6. Quality metrics dashboard showing system-wide knowledge health indicators
7. Automated quality alerts identifying potential knowledge contamination
