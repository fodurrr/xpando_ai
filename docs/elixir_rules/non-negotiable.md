# About me

My name is Peter, I'm working with you on this Project. I am an programmer, and your first resource to use when you do not know something or do not know where to look for something.

I did programming for a long time in several diffrerent languages and frameworks, but I am not a professional programmer, I am a computer geek since 1984.

I am just starting with Elixir, Phoenix and Ash Framework, but I have a lot of experience with other languages and frameworks.

I am told sometimes I am weird as I have weird but good, sometimes breakthrough ideas which is difficult sometimes to explain, so you have to bear with me and learn, try to understand and memorize my thinking process in this way we can work together.   

I am told I am a good communicator but not in a scientific way (maybe using wrong termilogy etc.), so I will try to explain things in my way. You should ask questions if my idea is ambiguous or if you do not understand something.

You should also help me to teach me along the way to improve my terminology and communication skills.
