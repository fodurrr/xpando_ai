Date: 2025-08-28
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0  
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 70/100 (Moderate Risk)

## High Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Distributed System Split-Brain Scenarios

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Network partitions are common in distributed systems, especially during deployment or infrastructure issues
**Impact**: High - Multiple leader nodes could corrupt network state, causing inconsistent topology tracking and potential data conflicts
**Mitigation**:

- Implement quorum-based decision making in NodeManager
- Add network partition detection with automatic recovery
- Design consensus mechanism for topology updates
- **Testing Focus**: Chaos engineering tests with network partitions, split-brain recovery scenarios

### 2. TECH-002: GenServer Cascade Failures

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Complex supervision trees with multiple GenServers increase failure cascade risk
**Impact**: High - Single node failure could trigger supervision tree collapse, bringing down entire cluster
**Mitigation**:

- Design proper OTP supervision strategies with restart limits
- Implement circuit breakers between components
- Add health checks with graceful degradation
- **Testing Focus**: Fault injection testing, supervision tree resilience tests

### 3. OPS-001: EPMD Port Discovery Failures

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - EPMD port discovery is notoriously problematic in containerized/cloud environments  
**Impact**: Medium - Nodes unable to discover each other prevents cluster formation
**Mitigation**:

- Configure explicit EPMD ports instead of dynamic assignment
- Add EPMD health monitoring and restart logic
- Document networking requirements for deployment environments
- **Testing Focus**: Network configuration tests, Docker/container discovery validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **Split-brain recovery testing**: Simulate network partitions and verify cluster recovers correctly
- **Fault injection testing**: Kill individual GenServers and verify supervision tree recovery
- **EPMD configuration testing**: Validate node discovery in various network configurations
- **Chaos engineering**: Random node failures during cluster operations

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests  

- **Load testing**: High-frequency heartbeats and message flooding scenarios
- **State consistency tests**: Verify topology tracking remains accurate during failures
- **Network congestion tests**: Validate gossip protocol behavior under load

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **Authentication validation**: Verify channel security using existing Token system
- **Scalability baseline**: Performance testing with 3-5 nodes as specified

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- TECH-001: Split-brain detection and recovery mechanisms
- TECH-002: Proper supervision tree design and circuit breakers
- OPS-001: Explicit EPMD configuration and monitoring

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Gossip rate limiting and monitoring alerts
- PERF-002: PubSub message batching and throttling
- DATA-001: State reconciliation mechanisms with manual recovery procedures

### Accepted Risks

- SEC-001: Low probability given existing auth system validation from Story 1.2
- BUS-001: Current 3-5 node requirement is achievable, future scaling can be addressed later

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Distributed system health**: Node count, cluster status, partition detection
- **GenServer supervision**: Restart rates, failure cascades, circuit breaker states  
- **Network performance**: Message throughput, gossip protocol efficiency, heartbeat latency
- **EPMD status**: Port availability, discovery success rates
- **State consistency**: Topology accuracy, node status synchronization

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Adding support for more than 5 concurrent nodes
- Changing networking infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Modifying supervision tree structure
- Integrating additional distributed protocols
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in Phoenix Channels
