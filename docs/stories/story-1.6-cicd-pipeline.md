# Story 1.6: CI/CD Pipeline & Testing Infrastructure

**Epic:** Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.6  
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Estimate:** 5 story points  

## User Story
**As a developer,**  
**I want automated testing, linting, and deployment pipeline,**  
**so that I can ensure code quality and deploy changes safely to production.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub Actions workflow configured for automated testing on pull requests and main branch
2. ExUnit test suite running with coverage reporting (minimum 80% coverage)
3. Credo linting and Dialyzer static analysis integrated in CI pipeline
4. Automated dependency vulnerability scanning with mix audit
5. Staging deployment to Fly.io triggered on main branch merges
6. Production deployment triggered only on tagged releases
7. Rollback procedures documented and tested for failed deployments
8. Branch protection rules enforcing CI checks before merge

## Technical Requirements
- GitHub Actions workflows
- ExUnit with coverage reporting
- Credo for code quality
- Dialyzer for static analysis
- mix audit for security scanning
- Fly.io deployment automation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CI/CD workflows created and tested
- [ ] All code quality checks passing
- [ ] Coverage reporting working (80%+ required)
- [ ] Staging deployment automated
- [ ] Production deployment process documented
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Project Foundation) must be completed

## Notes
Essential for maintaining code quality and enabling safe deployments throughout development.
