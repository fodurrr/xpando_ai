# Story 1.8: External Service Integration & Setup

**Epic:** Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.8  
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Estimate:** 4 story points  

## User Story
**As a system administrator,**  
**I want guided setup procedures for all external service dependencies,**  
**so that the platform can integrate with AI providers and blockchain services.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Documented procedures for creating accounts with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI
2. API key acquisition and configuration guide for each AI provider
3. Solana wallet creation and SPL token setup procedures documented
4. Test endpoints implemented for validating each external service connection
5. Fallback and offline development configurations for external service unavailability
6. Rate limiting and error handling implemented for all external API calls
7. Environment variable template (.env.example) with all required service keys
8. Integration health monitoring for detecting service outages or quota limits

## Technical Requirements
- OpenAI API integration
- Anthropic Claude API integration
- Google AI (Gemini) API integration
- Solana RPC API integration
- Rate limiting middleware
- Error handling and fallback logic

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Setup documentation created for all services
- [ ] Test endpoints working for each integration
- [ ] Environment variable template created
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Fallback configurations working
- [ ] Health monitoring active
- [ ] Integration tests passing

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Project Foundation) must be completed
- Story 1.9 (Security & Credential Management) should be completed first

## Notes
Enables integration with essential external services. Proper error handling critical for production reliability.
