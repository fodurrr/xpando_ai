# Story 1.3: Basic P2P Network Discovery & Communication

**Epic:** Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.3  
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Estimate:** 8 story points  

## User Story
**As a distributed AI node,**  
**I want to discover and connect with other nodes in the network,**  
**so that I can participate in collective learning and knowledge sharing.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. libcluster configured for automatic node discovery and clustering
2. GenServer-based node management with supervision trees for fault tolerance
3. Phoenix Channels implemented for real-time node-to-node messaging
4. Basic node status tracking (online, offline, connecting) across the network
5. Connection health monitoring and automatic reconnection logic
6. Network topology tracking showing which nodes are connected to which
7. Support for 3-5 concurrent nodes with stable connections

## Technical Requirements
- libcluster for node discovery
- GenServer supervision trees
- Phoenix Channels for real-time communication
- Node status monitoring
- Connection health checks
- Network topology management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] libcluster configured and working
- [ ] Node discovery functional across 3-5 nodes
- [ ] Phoenix Channels messaging operational
- [ ] Status tracking working reliably
- [ ] Health monitoring and reconnection tested
- [ ] Network topology visualization ready
- [ ] Fault tolerance tested
- [ ] Performance testing completed

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Project Foundation) must be completed
- Story 1.2 (Authentication) recommended for secure connections

## Notes
Core networking foundation for distributed AI collaboration. Critical for all P2P functionality.
