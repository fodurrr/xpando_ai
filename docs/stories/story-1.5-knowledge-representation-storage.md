# Story 1.5: Knowledge Representation & Storage

**Epic:** Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.5  
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Estimate:** 7 story points  

## User Story
**As an AI system,**  
**I want structured knowledge representation and persistent storage,**  
**so that I can capture, store, and share learning with other nodes effectively.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Knowledge Ash Resource defining structure for storing AI insights and learning
2. ash_postgres integration providing ACID-compliant knowledge persistence
3. Basic knowledge metadata including confidence scores, creation timestamps, source nodes
4. Knowledge versioning system tracking updates and improvements over time
5. Simple knowledge query interface for retrieving relevant information
6. Data validation ensuring knowledge integrity and preventing corruption
7. Support for different knowledge formats (text, structured data, embeddings placeholder)

## Technical Requirements
- Ash Framework resources and actions
- PostgreSQL with ash_postgres
- Knowledge data modeling
- Version control for knowledge objects
- Query interface implementation
- Data validation rules

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Knowledge Ash Resource implemented
- [ ] Database schema created and migrated
- [ ] Knowledge CRUD operations working
- [ ] Versioning system operational
- [ ] Query interface functional
- [ ] Data validation rules active
- [ ] Support for multiple knowledge formats
- [ ] Integration tests passing

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Project Foundation) must be completed
- Story 1.2 (Authentication) for access control on knowledge

## Notes
Foundation for all AI knowledge sharing. Critical for collective intelligence functionality.
