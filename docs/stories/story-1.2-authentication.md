# Story 1.2: Authentication & Node Identity Management

**Epic:** Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.2  
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Estimate:** 5 story points  

## User Story
**As a node operator,**  
**I want secure authentication and identity management for my AI node,**  
**so that I can participate in the network with verified identity and appropriate permissions.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ash_authentication configured with node registration and login capabilities
2. Node identity system supporting unique node IDs and cryptographic key pairs
3. Basic user authentication for web dashboard access
4. Permission system distinguishing node operators from regular users
5. Session management and secure token handling implemented
6. Node identity verification preventing duplicate or malicious registrations
7. Authentication policies integrated with all Ash Resources

## Technical Requirements
- ash_authentication 4.3+
- Cryptographic key generation for node identity
- Session management with secure cookies
- CSRF protection enabled

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Node registration flow implemented and tested
- [ ] User authentication working with proper session management
- [ ] Node identity verification system operational
- [ ] Permission system working across all resources
- [ ] Security measures implemented and tested
- [ ] Authentication policies applied to all Ash Resources
- [ ] All tests passing

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Project Foundation) must be completed

## Notes
Critical for network security and trust. Node identity forms the basis for P2P network participation.
