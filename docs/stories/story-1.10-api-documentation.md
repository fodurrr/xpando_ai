# Story 1.10: API Documentation & Developer Experience

**Epic:** Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.10  
**Priority:** Should Have  
**Estimate:** 4 story points  

## User Story
**As an API consumer,**  
**I want comprehensive API documentation and development tools,**  
**so that I can integrate with the platform and troubleshoot issues effectively.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Phoenix Channels API documented with message formats and event types
2. gRPC service definitions documented with Protocol Buffer schemas
3. REST API endpoints documented with request/response examples (if any)
4. Interactive API explorer integrated (Phoenix LiveDashboard or similar)
5. Code examples provided for common integration patterns
6. Error response formats and status codes clearly documented
7. Authentication and authorization procedures documented for API access
8. SDK generation scripts for common languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust)

## Technical Requirements
- Phoenix LiveDashboard integration
- API documentation generation
- Protocol Buffer documentation
- Code example generation
- SDK generation tooling

## Definition of Done
- [ ] API documentation complete and accessible
- [ ] Interactive API explorer working
- [ ] Protocol Buffer schemas documented
- [ ] Code examples provided
- [ ] Error documentation complete
- [ ] Authentication procedures documented
- [ ] SDK generation working
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved

## Dependencies
- Story 1.3 (P2P Network Communication) for Phoenix Channels API
- Future Epic 2 stories for gRPC implementation

## Notes
Essential for platform adoption and developer experience. Can be developed incrementally as APIs are implemented.
