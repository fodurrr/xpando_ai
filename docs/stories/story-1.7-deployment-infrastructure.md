# Story 1.7: Deployment Infrastructure & Environment Configuration

**Epic:** Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.7  
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Estimate:** 6 story points  

## User Story
**As a DevOps engineer,**  
**I want automated deployment to Fly.io with proper environment management,**  
**so that the application can be deployed reliably across staging and production.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. fly.toml configuration file with proper resource allocation and scaling settings
2. Fly.io app creation and initial deployment scripts documented
3. Environment-specific configurations (staging vs production) properly managed
4. PostgreSQL database provisioned and configured on Fly.io with backups
5. Redis cache instance configured and connected for session storage
6. SSL certificates and domain configuration completed
7. Health check endpoints implemented and configured in Fly.io
8. Monitoring and logging configured with Fly.io metrics and LogTail integration

## Technical Requirements
- Fly.io platform configuration
- PostgreSQL 16+ on Fly.io
- Redis 7.4+ for caching
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Health check endpoints
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Fly.io configuration complete and tested
- [ ] Database and Redis provisioned and working
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] Health checks operational
- [ ] Monitoring and logging active
- [ ] Staging and production environments working
- [ ] Deployment scripts tested
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Project Foundation) must be completed
- Story 1.6 (CI/CD Pipeline) recommended for automated deployment

## Notes
Critical infrastructure foundation enabling reliable application deployment and operation.
