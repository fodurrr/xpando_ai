# Story 1.9: Security & Credential Management

**Epic:** Foundation & Proof of Learning Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.9  
**Priority:** Must Have  
**Estimate:** 6 story points  

## User Story
**As a security engineer,**  
**I want secure credential storage and cryptographic key management,**  
**so that the platform protects sensitive data and prevents unauthorized access.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Application secrets encrypted using Elixir's built-in secret management
2. Database encryption at rest configured with proper key rotation
3. Node identity cryptographic key pairs generated and stored securely
4. API keys and external service credentials stored in Fly.io secrets
5. HTTPS enforcement with proper SSL/TLS configuration
6. Session security with secure cookies and CSRF protection
7. Input sanitization and validation preventing injection attacks
8. Security headers configured (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
9. Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse and DoS attacks

## Technical Requirements
- Elixir secret management
- Database encryption at rest
- Cryptographic key generation and storage
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Security headers and CSRF protection
- Rate limiting middleware
- Input validation and sanitization

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Secret management system operational
- [ ] Database encryption configured
- [ ] Cryptographic keys properly managed
- [ ] HTTPS enforced across all endpoints
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Penetration testing completed

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (Project Foundation) must be completed
- Story 1.7 (Deployment Infrastructure) recommended for secrets management

## Notes
Foundation for all platform security. Must be implemented before any external integrations or production deployment.
