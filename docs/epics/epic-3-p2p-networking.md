# Epic 3: P2P Network & Expert Specialization

## Epic Overview
Build the peer-to-peer network infrastructure enabling nodes to discover, connect, and collaborate. Implement expert specialization system allowing nodes to develop domain expertise across three initial dimensions. Scale the network to support 100+ concurrent nodes with fault tolerance and self-healing capabilities.

## Business Value
- Enables distributed AI collaboration without central servers
- Creates specialization marketplace for domain expertise
- Achieves 10x performance improvement on specialized tasks
- Reduces single points of failure through decentralization
- Establishes foundation for network effects and growth

## Success Metrics
- Network successfully scales to 100+ concurrent nodes
- Node discovery time under 10 seconds
- Specialization routing achieving 90%+ accuracy
- Network partition healing within 30 seconds
- 99.9% message delivery reliability
- Demonstrable performance improvement with specialized nodes

## Technical Requirements
- libcluster for automatic node discovery
- GenServer-based node management
- Phoenix Channels for real-time messaging
- Specialization dimensions as Ash attributes
- Network topology with clustering
- Byzantine fault tolerance for consensus

## Dependencies
- Epic 1 & 2 completed
- Network infrastructure (ports, firewalls)
- Distributed Erlang configuration
- Load testing tools setup

## Risks
- Network partitions causing split-brain (Mitigation: Implement proper consensus with quorum)
- Malicious nodes affecting network (Mitigation: Reputation system and node verification)
- Scaling bottlenecks (Mitigation: Hierarchical clustering approach)
